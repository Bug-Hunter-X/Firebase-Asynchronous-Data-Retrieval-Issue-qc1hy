# Firebase Asynchronous Data Retrieval Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications related to asynchronous data retrieval. The `bug.js` file showcases code that incorrectly handles the asynchronous nature of Firebase's `once()` method, leading to unexpected 'undefined' values.

The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, illustrates the correct way to handle asynchronous operations using Promises or async/await for reliable data access.
