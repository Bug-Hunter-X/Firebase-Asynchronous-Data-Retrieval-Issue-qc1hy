The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon Firebase error related to data retrieval and asynchronous operations:

```javascript
// Incorrect asynchronous handling
db.ref('users').once('value', function(snapshot) {
  const users = snapshot.val();
  console.log(users); // Might log 'undefined' sometimes
  // ... further operations using users data ...
});

// ... other code that might execute before the data is retrieved ...
```

This error often occurs because the `once()` method is asynchronous.  The code after the `once()` call continues to execute immediately before the data has been retrieved from Firebase. This can lead to `users` being `undefined` or null in the later part of your code.
